# EMF Datalogger
GUI program created to interface with different EMF measurement devices. Created for Prof. Jordan Morelli at Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario.

Features include realtime datalogging from all devices, as well the ability to automate scans accross the frequency spectrum using the RF Explorer. 

Designed to interface with the following devices:
 - SEI Inspector Geiger Counter
 - Tenmars TM192D Gauss Meter
 - Gigahertz Solutions HFW59D
 - RF Explorer 6G
 
An arduino is required to interface with the HFW59D, code can be found in the Arduino directory. This arduino can optionally be equipped with an Adafruit GPS Module, allowing for spatial tracking.
